### 5.1 Contributor Seats

Seats will be reserved for the top technical contributors, as measured by
non-trivial pull requests as determined by the core integrator team that have
been merged into the master in the previous 6 months.  These seats will be
reserved for active individual contributors who are neither employees of
CoreSpring, Inc. nor employees of companies that hold a corporate sponsor seat.

Organizations who provide significant sponsorship to the project will be offered a seat for the 
duration of their sponsorship term, unless seat is removed according to process described here.

(through any mechanism it deems appropriate) to the PIE Framework community at large

(if any) of the substance.

### 6.4

## 7.  Open Governance Principles

The PIE Framework Advisory Board will formulate recommendations in conjunction with
the following open governance principles:

  * Open Contributions: anyone should be able to participate and contribute to the project.
    All bugs and tasks will be tracked in a public tracker and all of the
    source code and all of the tools needed to build it will be available under
    an open license permitting unrestricted use.
  * Open technical meritocracy: technical merit over pride of authorship. Code
    is contributed for the express purpose of advancing technologies relevant
    to the project, effectively separating technology advancement from
    individual or commercial intent.
  * Open design: Roadmaps are discussed in the open, and designs receive input
    from all committers and contributors.
  * Influence through contribution: organizations and individuals gain
    influence over the project through contribution.
  * Open Licensing: code is licensed under the ISC license.
