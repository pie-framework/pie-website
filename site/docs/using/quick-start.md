# Quick Start

This is a quick demonstration of how to define, package and render an Assessment Item. 


## Getting Started

```
BOOOX
```

To package and view the example Assessment Item we will use the PIE CLI toolkit, this can be installed by using the following command in a terminal window.

```shell
npm install -g pie
```

> `npm` is included as part of the Node.js system. To use the command above you should first [download](http://nodejs.org/en/download/) and install node.

## Download the sample assessment item

In this example, we will use a sample assessment item definition to package and view an item using the PIE CLI. You can run `pie serve` and edit the sample definition files and see the changes come through in the browser.

* <a href="/assets/demo-item/config.json" download="config.json">Download config.json</a>
* <a href="/assets/demo-item/index.html" download="index.html">Download index.html</a>
* open a terminal in the directory of the downloaded files.

Or run the following script in a bash terminal:

```bash 
source <(curl -s http://pie-framework.org/assets/demo-item/install)
```

## Packing the item 

This will generate the javascript code needed to render the assessment item.

It will also build a sample html file for loading the item in a browser.


```bash
pie pack --includeComplete
```

## Previewing the item 

This will launch a server and you will be able to view the assessment item by opening the url:

`http://localhost:4000`

The example includes a control panel which allows you to modify the environment properties for viewing the item (for entering or evaluating a response for example.)


```bash
pie serve 
# then go to http://localhost:4000
```
