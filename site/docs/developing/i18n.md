# i18n - Internationalization 

A best-practice PIE should use the `env.lang` property to determine the desired language setting for the end user and display content for that language if it is available. 

Any change in the value of this property should be handled by updating the view.


## `pie-i18n` npm library

For simple and consistent use of localized content in PIEs we provide the `pie-lang` utility library.

This can be defined as a dependency for a PIE controller by adding it to the `controller/package.json` file.


```json
{
    "dependencies": {
        "pie-lang": "^1.0.0"
    }
}
```

And included in the PIE Controller `controller/controller.js`

```javascript
import i18n from "pie-lang";

```
