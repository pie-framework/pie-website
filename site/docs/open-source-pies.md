# Open Source PIEs


## Pre-Release Status Note

The PIE Framework is currently in pre-release.

CoreSpring is planning to release all of our question types including authorinng components as Open Source PIEs. You can see examples of these question types at www.corespring.org/samples, and authoring examples at www.corespring.org/authoring-demo.

We are working with partners to extend and enhance the set of Open Source question types and tools that will be made available and we welcome contributions.
